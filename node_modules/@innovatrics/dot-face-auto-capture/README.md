# Face Auto Capture Component

## Overview
Innovatrics Face Auto Capture Component is a web component that renders the video stream from an available phone or web camera to automatically capture an image of a userâ€™s face with the required quality.

The component output is a face image in the JPEG format and/or a proprietary file format for safe transfer to [Digital Identity Service](https://developers.innovatrics.com/digital-onboarding/technical/api-reference/) on server for further processing.
