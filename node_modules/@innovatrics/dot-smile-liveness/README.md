# Smile Liveness Component

## Overview

Innovatrics Smile Liveness Component is a web component that renders the video stream from an available phone or web camera to automatically capture two images of a userâ€™s face with the required quality. The component lays the foundation for a semi-passive liveness capture capability.

The component output is two face images (one with neutral expression, one smiling) in the JPEG format and/or a proprietary file format for safe transfer to [Digital Identity Service](https://developers.innovatrics.com/digital-onboarding/technical/api-reference/) on server for further processing.

The Smile Liveness Component can be used in combination with other components to develop remote identity verification or [digital onboarding solutions](https://www.innovatrics.com/digital-onboarding-toolkit/).
